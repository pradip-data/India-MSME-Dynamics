Power BI Desktop Comprehensive Conclusion on India's MSME Sector
The Indian Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSME) sector is pivotal to the nation’s economic growth, employment generation,
and industrial development. The detailed analysis of MSME data from various dimensions reveals important insights, opportunities,
and challenges:
1. Formalisation of MSMEs :
The registration of over 56.62 million MSMEs under the Udyam Portal (2020-2025) marks significant progress in
formalising the sector.
• Micro Enterprises dominate with 54.67% of registrations, emphasizing their critical role in grassroots-level
entrepreneurship and local economic upliftment.
• Small and Medium Enterprises, constituting 1.28% and 0.12%, respectively, highlight a significant gap in scaling
businesses. This underscores the need for targeted interventions to support MSMEs in transitioning to larger
enterprises.
• Geographical Concentration: Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat lead MSME
registrations. States with lower participation need incentives to promote entrepreneurial growth.
Recommendation : Enhance the scalability of micro enterprises through access to credit, skill development,
and streamlined regulations. Encourage MSME formalization in underrepresented states.
2. Gender Inclusion in MSMEs :
• Women-owned MSMEs account for 39% of registered enterprises, reflecting growing female entrepreneurship.
However, the gender gap persists, with 61% of enterprises owned by men.
• States like Tripura, West Bengal, Mizoram, and Manipur exhibit higher-than-50% women-owned MSMEs,
showing the potential of gender-targeted policies.
• Financial Constraints: Women-owned MSMEs face significant funding gaps, with a financial shortfall of $20.17
billion in 2017, equivalent to 0.76% of India’s GDP.
Recommendation : Launch gender-specific financial inclusion programs, mentorship, and networking
platforms. Close financial gaps by increasing access to credit and reducing constraints on women entrepreneurs.
3. Female Entrepreneurial Landscape :
• Despite a total female labor force population of 141.25 million, the ratio of female labor force participation to
women-owned MSMEs remains low, with a national average of 15%.
• States like West Bengal, Bihar, Tripura, and Delhi lead in this ratio, while states with high female labor
participation (e.g., Sikkim, Chhattisgarh) have low MSME participation.
Recommendation: : Align skill development programs for women with MSME sector opportunities.
Strengthen entrepreneurship ecosystems in states with high female labor force participation but low MSME
ownership.

4. MSME Manufacturing Sector :
• Manufacturing MSMEs account for only 19.79% of registrations, lagging behind services (35.04%) and trading (45.17%).
• Employment Contribution: The manufacturing MSME sector employs 11 million, contributing 30.36% of overall manufacturing
sector employment.
• High Potential Sectors: Subcategories like food products, wearing apparel, and textiles dominate, while areas like crude
petroleum extraction and remediation activities remain underrepresented.
Recommendation : Incentivize manufacturing MSMEs through tax relief, technological upgrades, and supply chain linkages.
Promote investments in underrepresented manufacturing subcategories for balanced growth.
5. Employment and GDP Contribution :
• MSMEs contribute significantly to India’s GDP, with their share fluctuating between 27.3% and 30.5% in recent years.
• Employment generation has risen dramatically, with 97 million jobs created by MSMEs in 2023-24, up from 35 million in 2021-22.
• The rural-urban divide is balanced, with 51% of MSMEs in rural areas and 49% in urban areas.
Recommendation : Strengthen MSMEs’ GDP contribution through policies that encourage innovation, exports, and digitization.
Enhance job quality and security to sustain employment growth.
6. Export Performance :
• MSMEs contributed 49.75% of exports in 2019-20, but the share declined to 43.59% in 2022-23, recovering slightly to 45.73% in
2023-24.
Recommendation : Focus on improving MSME competitiveness in global markets by providing export subsidies, logistical
support, and international trade exposure.
7. Financial Gaps and Challenges :
• The total financial gap for MSMEs in India was $230.54 billion in 2015, representing 11.1% of India’s GDP.
• Micro enterprises, though dominant in numbers, face significant funding shortages, with a financial gap of $8.96 billion.
• Small and medium enterprises face a financial gap of $221.11 billion, highlighting their constrained growth potential.
Recommendation : Bridge the financial gap through innovative credit models, fintech solutions, and risk-mitigated lending
schemes. Collaborate with private players to mobilize additional funding.
8. Policy and Strategic Focus :
• Ease of Doing Business: Simplify regulatory frameworks and compliance for MSMEs to reduce entry and operational barriers.
• Technology Adoption: Foster digital transformation in MSMEs by promoting access to technology and skills development.
• Cluster Development: Strengthen MSME clusters to foster innovation, knowledge sharing, and economies of scale.
• Sustainability Focus: Encourage sustainable practices, especially in manufacturing, to enhance MSME resilience and global
competitiveness.
